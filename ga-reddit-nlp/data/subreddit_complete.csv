315,1,Help me understand this issue (trans kids in competitive sports),djinnisequoia,self.Liberal,lbwyjc,5,5,"I will start out by saying that I'm a flaming progressive and I fully support all civil rights for the LGBTQ community. I am attempting to apply pure logic to the situation. (also, I think it was bullshit to bring it up in today's hearings. It just got me thinking)

So: we separate competitive sports into men's and women's divisions not because of any locker room privacy issue, but because there are genuine differences in typical strength and reach and weight etc. between men and women. Therefore it is not considered fair for the two to compete directly. 

I am assuming that a trans person under the age of 18 is pre-op and not taking hormones yet. (I may be mistaken here?) Therefore, their physical body at birth still corresponds to the gender division we all agree to have for competitive sports. 

As others have said, in wrestling for example athletes are further divided into weight classes, and this is not an issue. But in something like track, or another sport where there is a clear difference between what a typical male can achieve and what a typical female can achieve, it seems to me that a female who is obligated to wear a male's body until she can legally correct it still has kind of an unfair advantage when competing with females? 

But then again, a post-op trans person will still have pretty much the strength or reach or whatever that goes with their body type independent of their gender. 

I honestly don't know all the facts but I would like to formulate a position on this issue that is well-informed and respectful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/lbwyjc/help_me_understand_this_issue_trans_kids_in/,10,"[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9720445275306702}]"

From the article:

&gt;Former President  Donald J. Trump and the Republican Party entered this year having  stockpiled more than $175 million from fund-raising in November and  December based on his false claims of voter fraud, spending only a tiny  fraction on lawyers and bills for his effort to overturn the  presidential election, according to new campaign finance reports filed  on Sunday night.  
&gt;  
&gt;The picture that emerges in the new Federal Election Commission reports is  of Mr. Trump mounting a furious public relations effort to spread the  lie and keep generating money from it, rather than making a sustained  legal push to try to support his conspiracy theories.  
&gt;  
&gt;His  campaign’s single biggest expense in December was a nearly $5 million  media buy paid to the firm that bought his television advertisements.  His second-largest payment, $4.4 million, was for online advertising.  And the Republican National Committee pocketed millions of dollars in  donations — collecting 25 cents for every dollar Mr. Trump raised online  — in the final weeks of the year as it spent relatively little on legal  costs.  
&gt;  
&gt;All  told, Mr. Trump’s campaign spent only $10 million on legal costs —  about one-fifth of what it spent on advertising and fund-raising,  according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission filings from  Nov. 4 through the end of the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;During  that period, Mr. Trump’s conspiracy-fueled accusations that votes had  been miscounted or misappropriated repeatedly fell flat in the courts.  Joseph R. Biden Jr. was elected president by voters on Nov. 3, confirmed  by the Electoral College on Dec. 14 and ratified by Congress on Jan. 6 —  the same day that Mr. Trump incited a mob that stormed the Capitol.  
&gt;  
&gt;But  while Mr. Trump’s efforts to de-legitimize the election did not keep him  in power, they did spur millions in contributions from loyal supporters  and provided both him and the party with an enormous infusion of cash.

I'm just sitting here recalling all the times t\*\*\*\* and republicans endlessly kvetched about Obama making ""millions"" ""during"" his presidency; the facts are that Obama made money off of book deals following his tenure.

t\*\*\*\* actively spent his entire presidency grifting, lying, and destroying anything and anyone that got in the way of his grifting.

Meanwhile, like brain-dead tithers, the cult continues to put money in t\*\*\*\*'s collection plate, thinking they're ""fighting for 'murica.""

I have strong liberal values. Pro-choice, pro-environment, BLM, LGBT rights, universal healthcare, pro-union, etc. I believe in having a strong government and regulations to ensure that these values are protected. However, I HATE it when I come to face with these regulations. For example, I hate having to update my car’s registration and think “I take care of my car, why do I have to do this? I’m not the problem”. I have to remind myself the benefits of this system and how I wouldn’t want to get rid of it as to ensure our community’s vehicles are safe for all. I have to remind myself that I cannot be an exception so comply accordingly. A similar situation is all the training I have to do for work. Again, it’s to protect values important to me but I have a tendency to think that this shouldn’t apply to me and it’s unnecessary. I feel bad when this occurs since it’s hypocritical to want a system but be exempt from it and it’s also sorta conservative which I cannot stand nor want to be part of.

1017,1,No one knows what terrorism is,AustralianFridge,self.Liberal,ksm1nu,24,0,"I have argued with so many rightwing fundamentalists about BLM protests and Antifa, and this sentence comes up constantly... ""they are the textbook definition of terrorism."" 



Well, I say to them, ""there is no textbook definition of terrorism."" It is infamously hard to define. We know it involves political violence, coercion, the fungibility of targets. On paper, it becomes hard to distinguish an intelligence agency or political professor's definition of terrorism from war or a riot. 


Defining terror becomes a standard of ""I know it when I see it"" and we all see differently. 


The events of yesterday, the storming of the capital, were not acts of terrorism. That is contentious to say. It certainly tasted like terrorism, with makeshift pipe bombs allegedly placed outside the DNC and RNC offices. It certainly was textbook insurrection. We certainly saw online radicalization turned physical, and a loose coalition that almost certainly contained neo-confederates, fascists, and violent militia members. 


But the right and left have both lowered the bar in defining terrorism to condemn the actions of the other. 


We witnessed utter contempt for democracy, unbridled rage, utter disregard for facts. We witnessed white supremacy, from the confederate flags to the muted reaction of police. The utter lack of preparation by officers is itself a reflection of white supremacy, as a rally of black activists in similar size gathered at the Ellipse would have prompted immediate police response. 


And yet we should not let the unacceptable events of yesterday impact our wording. Charlottesville was terrorism, the planned kidnapping of Gretchen Witmer was terrorism, the litany of ideological shootings and white nationalist violence are terrorism. Trump's entire manner of communicating with his base seems to rely on stochastic terrorism. We have no shortage of examples of terrorism from this camp. 


The actions of yesterday, horrible in all their ways, should not reach the bar for this very serious word. I think if you reflect, you realize it does not meet the standard, I think everyone calling it terrorism has to do a little internal litigating to themselves to justify using the word. And I think if we cannot find ways to condemn yesterday without conjuring this very very serious charge we are in some capacity being dishonest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/ksm1nu/no_one_knows_what_terrorism_is/,6,"[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995294809341431}]"

I am a life long conservative. As in never voted for a democrat in my short 10 years of voting, save this year. Mike Espy is the first Democrat I’ve ever voted for. That information should tell you enough about where I live, and just how conservative it is. 

After the last 4 years of Trump, and seeing everything happen in the Senate even this week, I am DONE with the Republican Party. 

My problem is. I’m pro life, which obviously the Democratic Party is pro choice. I am not coming here to be explained to how I’m wrong for being pro life or anything like that. I just want help on how to navigate it. How can I vote for someone who may not be “pro life” but is still the better candidate? How do I reconcile the two? Basically I want someone to tell me it’s ok to be pro life, but understand I need to vote for the best person for the overall job I guess.

1227,1,"For the love of God, we need to learn how to take yes for an answer",1000101001001010,self.Liberal,kingoe,9,1,"Re: $2000 stimulus 
 
Look. I get it. Democrats have been trying to push through increased stimulus through for months and Senate Republicans (McConnell et al) have always blocked it, refused to even consider more than $600, tried to guarantee employers can’t be sued for exposing their workers to COVID, decreased unemployment, pushed for a Wall Street slush fund etc. When the $600+pork bill passed, all the Republican constituents are mad because they believe that “Pelosi and Congress” are the ones responsible for the holdup, the added pork, and the meager amount of stimulus $$$, and their politicians are more than happy to blame it on Pelosi.
 
Which is extremely frustrating! They’re blaming us, when it’s the very politicians they voted for that are fucking them over! I get it! Aaaagh! 
 
But then, today, in response to the backlash, Trump (who almost certainly has no comprehension of what’s in the bill or what it all means) “demanded” payments of $2000 for the American people. So, great, right? Checkmate Mitch. I mean, this is a huge opportunity. Thanks to Trump, the GOP just fumbled the ball at the one-yard line, and all we have to do is shut the fuck up and punch it in. It’s crazy! Republican constituents — all of them — are not only clambering for something *extremely* progressive; it’s the exact same thing that democrats have been trying to pass for months! All we have to do is give them what they want, and there is a clear and obvious answer to how we bring it home: just pretend Trump won this battle. “Capitulate” to the “will of the people.” Let MAGA feel like they swayed us, and we all get checks!
 
Except for some inane reason, Democrats seem completely unable to take yes for an answer, and are oblivious to how incredibly fucking easy it is to psychologically manipulate Trump and his entire base.
 
All the Dems have to do here is say “yes, Mr. President, brilliant idea! The American people have spoken, and we’re following your lead.” That’s it. It’s a win-win: the Trumpers get to feel smug that their orange god bent the Democratic pussies to his will, Trump gets to brag about it forever, and liberals get the satisfaction of knowing that we fleeced the Cheeto twat by working him like a used car salesman. Any democratic voter with an IQ over 50 would know exactly what we’re doing. But beyond all that, most importantly - so much so that it dwarfs everything else, actually - *the American people will finally get more money.*

But noooooooo. What are we seeing right now? 
 
A bunch of fucking finger pointing, and the exact same tribal warfare bullshit we hate the GOP for. Apparently, we also have to *win.* We have to make it clear that this was all actually the Republican’s fault, that Trump still shouldn’t be praised because he should have done it months ago, that the party that’s trying to American’s wallets is, in fact, the democrats.
 
But why?
 
I genuinely don’t get it. I really don’t. What the fuck is up with this “well look who finally came out of his room to socialize for once” energy? How does that help anything? Look, I’m not saying that we should have some “join hands across the aisle” love fest with the GOP. Not at all. It’s not our job to “heal” for all the awful and racist shit they did. But this is sales 101 shit. Day 1 basics: if someone is agreeing with you, you always let them feel like it was their brilliant idea —

1438,1,I Genuinely Want To Know Liberal Beliefs,friedrickshrimp,self.Liberal,k9adi9,21,1,"Hi, I'm a conservative. WAIT WAIT WAIT. Please. Don't downvote me yet. I just want to know this side of the argument. After having seen a good amount of my fellow conservatives become radical right-winged people screaming ""election fraud"" from the highest mountains, I've realized that they're practicing the same hypocrisy that they supposedly stood against, and it got me thinking ""liberalism might not be as bad as I thought..."" so I have some questions on liberal beliefs, because I think I might actually be more liberal than I first thought...

1. What exactly is a bigot? According to the far right, to liberals, a bigot is anyone who disagrees with their political views.  I seriously doubt this, and just want to know what you define as ""bigotry"". 
2. What is ""free speech"" and what's the opposing argument for media censorship? I have personally seen Facebook, Twitter, etc... censor anyone who mentions anything remotely supporting the idea of election fraud. While I do think the election is legitimate, I think the media censoring ideas like this is out of their place. Even the flat-earth stuff. It's obviously wrong, but I don't think youtube should be censoring it. Isn't the ability to spread lies part of free speech? What's the liberal view on it?
3. Should diversity or eligibility be more important? For me, a computer scientist, I'm against the idea of hiring someone for diversity's sake (that said, I am for hiring regardless of minority groups). Say I own an app development company, and I'm hiring programmers, and a hispanic lesbian comes in to interview, and knows nothing about coding, and then a white straight male walks in, demonstrating tons of coding skill. I'd hire the straight white male, because he's more eligible for the job he needs to work. And according to the far right, this is what liberalism is all about, is throwing eligibility out the window, and prioritizing diversity. What REALLY is the take on diversity?
4. How can equality be obtained? According to the far-right, liberals believe giving benefits to those who are ""oppressed"" (I put oppressed in quotes because whether or not they are oppressed is a dead-end debate. I'm not saying they're not, I'm also not saying they are.) will fix all the problems. I don't think that trying to cancel out the ""benefits"" (same reason for quotes here) that their comparison has by giving them benefits will do much. That's not promoting equality, that's promoting bias on the other side in hopes of cancelling out the original bias. Once again, I don't believe this is actually the case. How do you ACTUALLY think equality can be obtained? And if you do believe the above, can you please tell me how it will do anything, because as far as I've seen it's done nothing but make conservatives mad.

Thank you so much, I really just want to see the argument from the not-extreme. I don't want the radical-left, and I don't want the radical-right, because all they do is call each other names and throw rocks at each other. And sadly, most media is either radical-left or radical-right. I want to see the ACTUAL argument between liberal views and conservative views, and this seems to be a good spot for it.

1485,1,How do I share my opinions in a liberal environment as a conservative?,Soulgiver831,self.Liberal,k6f4zr,0,1,"I just finished up a class for education majors, the main focus of it being how to handle students' environment at help, make sure that they're being treated in a way that can help them succeed in the best possible way, and making sure that we as teachers are making our students as comfortable and safe in the classroom environment as possible. The class went great, made a 92 and everything. However, a lot of topics, understandably, got very political. During the first of these, I mentioned that I was a conservative but still in the middle on whether I was Democrat or Republican but leaning republican slightly. And half the class looked at me like I just said I murdered someone. This persisted throughout the year with a majority of the class making sure that anytime I brought up a conservative stance opinion that I was shut down in a sense. For example one time we were discussing how we should handle students with social economic issues at home, kids who are homeless, etc etc. One student suggested that we could get these students care packages of things they can't afford. I said that if we're doing that we should give something to the other children as well, maybe jot on the same scale, but just something. I immediately saw about 12 hands shoot up, and all 12 of them spent about 15 minutes telling me about how that was a horrible idea. I want things to be different next year, I want to engage in discussions and actually learn more about this. I'm new to politics and everything so far just seems really confusing and I just feel lost. Normally I would go to the conservative reddit with an issue like this but I feel like it would be better and more critical of me to get an opinion from a liberal point of view.

1831,1,Please explain...,Totes_Dangerous,self.Liberal,jsgm6t,1,1,".. I guess I should have said ""former liberal"" (full disclosure) but I COME IN PEACE. Please enlighten me about how you see the next two statements. 
1.) Trump is often accused of racism, but did he not at least make a good-faith effort to improve black communities by providing jobs and reforming the criminal justice system to make it easier to transition into society after being incarcerated? Perhaps some faults or flaws can be found with these efforts, but don't they at least signify a meaningful gesture, a small step in the right direction? Were his efforts ill-conceived, misconstrued, harmful, destructive, malevolent in intention or outright fabrications that never took place?
2.)  Before choosing Kamala Harris and before being chosen as Obama's VP, Joe Biden was recorded speaking about how impressed he was with BHO as a candidate. So remarkable for a black candidate to be ""clean, well-spoken, articulate and nice-looking"" that Biden called it ""storybook"". Of course, it was meant as a compliment, and it didn't hurt Biden much, obviously. But is that not beyond simple ignorance or a prejudiced stereotype? Isn't that the most deeply and inherently racist thing one can say, that they are impressed with a candidate who can sound intelligent and be presentable  while being black as well? How can someone who has held public office for so long be surprised or impressed by this? In short, isnt that racist?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/jsgm6t/please_explain/,2,"[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.642863929271698}]"

After 4 years of racist, misogynistic, bigoted and hateful rhetoric why would anyone possibly vote for Trump if they didn't agree with him explicitly?   I could respect not voting at all if they didn't like Biden/Harris.   I disagree with their assessment but I respect their conviction.   

This revisionist nonsense going on now is weak and obvious.   

Look, I don't know if they are in 100% agreement with the president on everything but make no mistake.  Trump IS most likely a criminal and quite frankly if he was a Democrat, the senate would have removed him from office.    Conservatives and Republicans don't care at all about what Trump has done.   They only care about stacking the courts with regressive ideogues who decide based upon personal morality rather than the constitution and case law.

I worked for a Union insurance company for a while and they always asked me why I took a job there like it was some kind of bad thing. I've never really understood why but according to how they think, it's because they are always backed by Democrats. That's literally the only reason I can think of or see.

Since Trump took office they have both supported ""made in America"" products and companies. I brought to their attention that Trump and Ivanka both have their clothing line made in China, which they just choose to ignore. Just looking at some of the swag I've gotten from various campaigns and candidates, they all have Union labels on them and are made in the US. A majority of the Trump flags that I've seen people with are made in China. I checked a few in my neighborhood, and they were all made in China.

I've read a few places that Union members actually voted for Trump in a higher percentage this election. That's alarming to me.

What I don't understand is why Republicans still seem to overwhelmingly be against Unions if they want to support working class people and made in America businesses.

I live in a deeply rooted conservative state. I have agreed with, and voted republican for years. But, as I get older I start to have views on both sides. I just wanted to say to all the democrat voters, ""Thank you"". I sincerely mean that.

For the past few months my eyes have opened to how terrible and how absolutely ridiculous Trump is. That being said, I am still a republican and will still vote republican. But let's be real, no matter your side, or your beliefs, you have to realize as a human being it was time for a change. 

I do not much agree with a lot of Bidens ideas, but I respect the outcome of the election and I hope he can bring true and beneficial change to our country. So, again. Thank you for voting! 

Since the election, I find it very funny and also very embarrassing to be associated with conservatives. The hashtag #NotmyPresident is coming back, the utter hypocrisy from the right on this election. The ""snowflakes"" are falling again. But this time, its all the right. And it embarrasses me that we can't just accept it and come together to make this country better. 

I'm sorry for the long post. Again, I needed to say that and I can't very well do it in my circle of friends and family. 

I do sincerely mean what I have said. Thank you! Thank you for coming out in record numbers and voting trump out. Thank you. I truly hope this country will benefit from this in the next 4 years. 

And on my behalf, to all democrats and left wing supporters, no hard feelings. I do not hold political beliefs against someone. Its their right and freedom. Thats why America is great. And hopefully it will become better.

I am no fan of trump but i will say that as bad as his ideas were he fought tooth and nail to get them done maybe more vocal and determined than any politician of late. As we went into this election i felt there were some very strong democratic contenders for president but at the end it eventually came down to the two worst people of the crop almost as if they were pre ordained. I cant help but feel that Biden is just another version of George W as he seems to have handlers that call the shots for him and Harris seems to be nothing more than clinton in black face. Yes Trump is gone but was there any gain made by removing him. The senate looks like its still republican and it appears that the house lost a lot of seats. I honestly feel like we are getting rolled back to the pre Obama all talk and nothing gets done political landscape.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/jpdzgv/is_it_a_real_victory/,5,"[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9995433688163757}]"

Hey guys. I myself would identify as conservative. Grew up in a fairly liberal household and over time for a myriad of reasons pertaining to my career etc. have been more conservative.

I think an integral part to progressing as a nation and as cohesive people is the ability to accept that: things may or may not have gone the way you hoped for in the recent election, but we have stand behind the winning candidate because like it or not, that is your president. 

I personally did not vote for Joe Biden for reasons relating to my personal finances and the industry I am in, but from the looks of it, he’s going to be running shop the next 4 years. We’re never going to get anywhere if the right retreats so far right, and the left retreats so far left. 

We are always going to disagree on issues, and more often than not our stances are going to be directly correlated to our personal situation or life experiences. I think it’s important to be understanding and realize that we are not going to agree on everything. 

My question is this, what do you think we can do to open the line of communication between different demographics to reduce hostility? Both sides have become increasingly defensive, and it’s gotten far from healthy. How can we learn to accept our differences but move together for the greater good of our country and communities at a community level?

2220,1,"Biden supporters, how would you convince me to vote for Biden?",mooonswimmer,self.Liberal,jmrx62,7,1,"I'm Gen Z, first time voter. I've spent most of my life in NYC, but also a few years in Ireland and Morocco. I grew up in a lower-middle class, religious household that voted Democrat, but my family was open to discourse, so I was never ""indoctrinated"". I'm not a fan of labels, but I'm queer, a POC and Jewish. Most people assume I should be left leaning.

How would Biden and the Democratic Party's policies affect me, as someone who will soon start to pursue their higher education, and as someone who has recently become financially independent and now has to deal with money? Convince me that I wouldn't have to worry about student loans and healthcare. Convince me that blue collar workers will benefit from Biden's fiscal policies.

I don't necessarily believe in America being the world's policeman, but I think we should intervene in certain foreign conflicts when necessary, and exert economic and political pressure on oppressive regimes and leaders. How would Biden deal with the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict that has killed hundreds of civilians this past month, for example? Would we try to improve our relationships with Iran and Cuba under a Trump administration?

How would Biden deal with police brutality and race issues? In what ways are the Trump and Biden immigration/gun policies different? Environmental policies?

Would Biden be better than Trump when it comes to bringing the pandemic under control and reviving the economy? Would I fare better in a Biden economy or a Trump economy?

There are many other crucial issues, but I cannot ask about everything, so feel free to comment about anything I haven't mentioned!

I appreciate everyone's responses! If you're unable to respond to each question, just one or two is more than enough and greatly appreciated!

I apologize if this isn't the right sub, or if my questions are too vague and I'm asking about things most people don't really have a certain answer to. Everyone wants to forcibly shove their opinion down your throat and hear it parroted back (both sides), which have made it really hard for me to have any neutral, and objective discussions.

The Covid numbers here aren't great, and the states all around us are a total Covid clusterfuck. We need less Covid, not more, and a big political rally is probably going to lead to a lot of deaths, ultimately.

Can you help us keep the numbers lower by RSVPing to this rally, then not going? You can register for up to 2 free tickets per phone number at the Trump campaign site linked to in the article. Register yourself, your cat, your dog, whoever! You do need to respond to the text for them to count you as registered.

Thanks in advance. I really don't want the numbers spiking!

2376,1,Election Probabilities Based on Logistic Regression,LostInOxford,self.Liberal,jjtm5q,11,1,"If this is not a good subreddit for this, please remove.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional pollster.  The following is a result of my own statistical analysis.

As a data scientist, this election cycle has gotten me really interested in polling and probabilities.  Also, Nate Silver is extremely interesting to listen to.  So, I decided to do some logistic regression on the last six elections (1992-2016) to get an idea of what Joe and Kamala need to have the highest chance of winning.

I used the results by state data from past elections to train the model, and estimated which states go blue/red from recent polling data.  To make it a little bit more consistent, I used the default map from 270 To Win ([https://www.270towin.com/](https://www.270towin.com/)).

If a state is safe blue/red, that state is automatically assigned to the respective party.  All states classified as leaning or toss-ups were given an in-between value so both candidates get partial credit.

Safe Blue: California (55), New York (29), Illinois (20), New Jersey (14), Washington (12), Massachusetts (11), Maryland (10), Connecticut (7), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Hawaii (4), Delaware (3), District of Columbia (3), Vermont (3) and Maine ME-1 (1), for a total of 183 Electoral Votes.

Likely Blue: Virginia (13), Colorado (9), New Mexico (5) and Maine Statewide (2), for a total of 29 Electoral Votes.

Leans Blue: Pennsylvania (20), Michigan (16), Arizona (11), Minnesota (10), Wisconsin (10), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4) and Nebraska NE-2 (1), for a total of 78 Electoral Votes.

If everything from leans blue and up are correct, that's 290 Electoral Votes...game over.  On the flip side...

Leans Red: Texas (38)

Likely Red: Indiana (11), Missouri (10), South Carolina (9), Kansas (6), Utah (6), Alaska (3) and Montana (3), for a total of 48 Electoral Votes.

Safe Red: Tennessee (11), Alabama (9), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Oklahoma (7), Arkansas (6), Mississippi (6), West Virginia (5), Idaho (4), North Dakota (3), South Dakota (3), Wyoming (3), Nebraska Statewide (2), Nebraska NE-1 (1) and Nebraska NE-3 (1), for a total of 78 Electoral Votes.

If everything red shakes out as planned, that's only 163, which is nowhere near enough.

Which leaves us with the toss-up states of Florida (29), Ohio (18), Georgia (16), North Carolina (15), Iowa (6) and Maine ME-2, for a total of 85 Electoral Votes.

If you assign all leaning states as toss-ups, candidate win probabilities are Trump/Biden (51%/49%).  Even if we give all leaning red states to Trump, it doesn't up his win probability, meaning those states aren't that important for Biden.

If we assign blue/red leaning states to each respective candidate, the probabilities become Biden/Trump (68%/32%).

If Biden wins Iowa, his win probability jumps to 72%.  If he wins Ohio, it jumps to 74%.  If he wins Florida, it jumps to 79%.  If he wins all three, it jumps to 82%.  While I understand that leaves Trump an 18% chance, it is very unlikely he has a path to victory after losing all three.

I hope you guys enjoyed my mental Jackson Pollock.  I'd love to answer any questions about the data or scenarios, if anyone has any.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/jjtm5q/election_probabilities_based_on_logistic/,6,"[{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9918993711471558}]"

2425,1,Call to action: Urge your senators to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act of 2020,bugleweed,self.Liberal,jj5cuo,11,1,"### Background

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was enacted to insure that the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was enforced and that no one, including federal, state or local government may in any way impede people from registering to vote or voting because of their race or ethnicity. Most provisions in the VRA, and specifically the portions that guarantee that no one may be denied the right to vote because of his or her race or color, are permanent.

Section 5 of the VRA requires certain states or jurisdictions which have an established history of laws or policies which discriminate obtain advance approval or “preclearance” from the US Department of Justice or the US District Court for D.C. before they can make any changes to voting practices or procedures.  Examples of these changes which must be “precleared” include any change in the date, time, place, or manner under which an election is held. Federal approval is to be given as soon as the state or jurisdiction proves that the proposed change would not abridge the right to vote on account of race or language minority status.

On June 25, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in the case of Shelby v. Holder in which the Court did not invalidate the principle of preclearance. The Supreme Court did decide, however, that Section 4(b) of the VRA, which establishes the formula that is used to determine which states and jurisdictions must comply with preclearance, is antiquated and thus unconstitutional and can no longer be used. Thus, although Section 5 prevailed, it is currently not being used.  The U.S. Supreme Court also made it clear in its decision that a new, updated preclearance formula can and should be designed by the U.S. Congress, and signed into law.
