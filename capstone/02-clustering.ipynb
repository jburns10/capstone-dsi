    "### Summary\n",
    "This notebook contains some attempted clustering to try to group my clues in the dataset into more organic categories. I referred to week 8 lessons about K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN, but I couldn't manage to capture much more than noise. I fit both models onto my full datasset with a tfidf vectorizer to no avail. Additionally, the truncated dataset of the top 25 Jeopardy categories was fit with DBSCAN, also with little success. I would like to work more with this in the future to see if I can find a workable solution to try to capture more signal in the clues, and subsequently attempt classification models through transfer learning in this instance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this was a late stage attempt in my porject process, I have included it as the second notebook in the series since the intention was to move forward with any successes to the modeling phase."

With more time, I think I could have found a more workable number of clusters, however, time did not permit due to extensive time cost during training.  \n",
